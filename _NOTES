We start with a cohort that has at least one visit in young and one visit in old
This cohort is where we can derive the "truth"
(can't use participants who weren't present in the `old` subset as we don't know their outcome)

We then divide and mask the cohort. 

We can't carry anything from BEFORE the mediator measurement. 
*split the cohort BEFORE carrying forward any observations*

We can carry forward observations in the younger cohort up to 2006, but we shouldn't use them in the matching process. We will limit matching variables to those values from 2006. 


Probably can't carry forward observations in the older cohort

`RELIGION`, `MILITARY`, `EDU_NEW` are not time-varying in HRS. 
`ALCOHOL_NOW`, `MARRIAGE` are asked every year
`ALCOHOL_EVER` is built from ALCOHOL_NOW
